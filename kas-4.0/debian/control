Description: This tool provides an easy mechanism to setup bitbake based projects.
 The OpenEmbedded tooling support starts at step 2 with bitbake. The
 downloading of sources and then configuration has to be done by hand. Usually,
 this is explained in a README. Instead kas is using a project configuration
 file and does the download and configuration phase.
 .
 This package installs kas-container, a shell script to run kas in an OCI
 container.
