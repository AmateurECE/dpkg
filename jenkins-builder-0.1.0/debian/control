Description: Automatically build Jenkins projects
 This is a simple project. I use Jenkins to build some static websites that I
 serve behind Nginx. Since the static website data can be generated from
 scratch at any time, I'm using ephemeral volumes for storage of the build
 artifacts. This application just ensures that a single build exists after the
 container starts up.
